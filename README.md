# StudyMate AI

StudyMate AI is an AI-powered study assistant that helps students learn from their own study material. Users can upload notes in different formats, ask questions, generate quizzes, and create flashcards. The application uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide responses based only on the uploaded documents instead of relying on general knowledge.

This project was developed as part of our **Generative & Agentic AI Summer Internship Program (SIP 2026)** capstone.

## Project Overview

Many students rely on notes from lectures, PDFs, and presentations while preparing for exams. Finding information from these resources can be time-consuming. StudyMate AI helps by allowing users to upload their study material and interact with it through an AI assistant. The application uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) so that responses are based on the uploaded documents, making them more relevant and reducing incorrect answers.

## How It Works

1. The user uploads a study document.
2. The document is processed and split into smaller chunks.
3. The chunks are converted into embeddings and stored in ChromaDB.
4. When the user asks a question, the most relevant chunks are retrieved.
5. Groq generates a response using the retrieved context.
6. The same knowledge base is also used to generate quizzes and flashcards.

## Running the Project

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikita-Gupta280/StudyMate-AI.git
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

Windows

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file and add your Groq API key.

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Run the backend.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend_new

streamlit run app.py
```
